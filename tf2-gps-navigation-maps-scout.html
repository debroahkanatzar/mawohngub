Back to my days surveying offshore. So, we were working off the coast of Japan, surveying the ocean floor looking for a good route to run a subsea fiberoptic cable. This was in 2000 or 2001. I was the systems administrator and data processor. As I've said in previous posts, I typically worked a 12 hour shift, in this case 6am to 6pm. Part of finding a good cable route was making sure you didn't drape the cable over any cliffs, seamounts, volcanoes, etc. We had a number of people responsible.

Full disclosure: I'm a Cartographer and run Axles and Antennas (dot com) and took this course as a refresher. I have this review I just posted this morning on my website, but will paste the WALL OF TEXT here (I like to write, lol).

GPS Navigation & Maps. Online & offline. Incredible technology. I had to ease into my turn for the fourth time that morning as I sidled onto a paved road mottled with ice, the gleaming spots making traction a poorly-kept promise. I was still more than ten minutes’ slow drive from the house, and I was carefully monitoring nearby traffic as the city started to wake up.

In light of Apple's recent announcements about its maps app, the idea of another navigation app for the iPhone might seem redundant, but Apple's program. I purchased a 2018 rav4 and was told the navigation system "Uses the GPS in your phone" But it appears to me there is no navigation in the car the radio connects to this app call "Scout GPS Link" that is not very good. Scout GPS Link doesn't use a map it just has a green arrow that says "Take this left" and that is not helpful if there are multiple turns and to make it worse it is usually at least 100 yards behind my current position. The Traffic app gives me a view of the North East United. iOS App Store Link: https://geo.itunes.apple.com/de/app/g.

I'm a trained first-aider, an occasional outdoors chef, and a lover of nature. I spend my time in moderately low terrain, surrounded by meadows, forests, and lakes. The woodland around me is predominantly pine, spruce, and silver birch. What am I not? I'm not a prepper, survivalist, ultralighter, mall ninja, or historical recreationist.

I prefer to get the unit with the car instead of going for an aftermarket option. I actually love the simplicity of the unit when it comes to radio, etc. I don't mind the cost either, as I know it is much more expensive than more robust aftermarket units.

But recently whenever I pull up Maps and attempt to navigate, the navigation simply doesn't move. I've had my GPS set to high accuracy and everything.

However, when I type in an address and "start" the navigation, the screen switches to the navi scree.
